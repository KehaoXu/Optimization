# Frog Call-Based Classification Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify datasets using different machine learning models (such as logistic regression and kernel SVM) and compare their performance. The project uses `train.csv` and `test.csv` as training and testing datasets.

## File Structure
- `final_project.pdf`: Project requirements
- `final.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook file containing project code and analysis
- `test.csv`: Testing dataset
- `train.csv`: Training dataset

## Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- cvxpy
- numpy

## Usage
1. Clone or download this project to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas cvxpy numpy
    ```
3. Run `final.ipynb` to view and execute the project code.

## Results
In this project, we compared the test and training errors of different models and analyzed the confusion matrix. Detailed results can be found in the output of `final.ipynb`.
